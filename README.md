PlaiCraft Project




High-level question: (Probably) Q2 (predicting high playtime)
    -> Current Interest: Predicting playtime from age and gender
        -> Probably a linear regression(?)



Notes:
  Expecting age to be highly influential (lower age = more time available to play)

  Andrew: Available for anything, volunteers for programming in particular
  
  Emma: Available for anything, volunteers for writing final report/prose specifically
